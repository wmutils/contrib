    # .. if we're on the last row, display all the remaining windows
    # eg: if we have 12 windows, the square root would be 3 (truncated).
    # so the script would draw a 3x3 grid. This would leave 3 windows apart. To
    # avoid this, we set the number of columns of the last row as
    #
    #    12 - 3 * (3-1)
    # => 12 - 3 * 2
    # => 12 - 6
    # == 6
    # so we will have 6 windows on the last row, instead of 3.
    # This do not lead to the best looking grid, I know (the best one would be
    # 3x4), but it's the simplest algo I've found. Don't forget we're playing
    # with shell scripts here, not matlab..
